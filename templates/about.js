    content: `Cloud V (sometimes stylized as CloudV) is a cloud-based hardware development platform. It is built by a team of researchers encompassing professors, graduate and undergraduate students from The American University in Cairo and Brown University.

Cloud V allows users to write, simulate and synthesize Verilog modules in the cloud using open source tools such as Icarus Verilog and the Yosys simulator, with a custom-designed, powerful yet incredibly simple IDE inspired by contemporary software development IDEs, as well as a variety of tools to assist with development such as a system-level editor, a finite state machine editor, a RISC-V bus functional model, and more.`,
